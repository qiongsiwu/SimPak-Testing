This is the first file that I uploaded to the repository. I am also new to Git. 

I had a discussion with Ray today and he preferred Google Code for project hosting. I have been fascinated by GitHub for a while and after some research, I found that Google might very likely move to Git from SVN in a short period of time. Therefore using Git for project hosting seems rational to me. 

Indeed, Git is quite new to everyone. I hope we can all learn through this experience.
